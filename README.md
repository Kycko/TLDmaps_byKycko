# TLD maps by Kycko
I'm creating maps for The Long Dark using Inkscape and SVG format ^_^. I'm creating from scratch, but I try to keep the layout and design of [Whiteberry's maps](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=530202531).

Note that my maps are licensed under GPLv3, so you can:
* use it for free ^_^
* share it for free wherever you want (just be sure to provide a link to my repository)
* modify it for free and share your work (just keep in mind your maps should be licensed under GPLv3 too, and also you have to provide a link to my repository)

I'll be glad to see any pull requests that can help to provide the best and the most relevant maps for The Long Dark.

**And I hope you'll enjoy my work and the game itself :)**

## Requirements
I use [Ubuntu fonts](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/) in my maps, so be sure to install it before you will modify my sources.
